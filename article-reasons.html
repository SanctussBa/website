        <h3>50 Reasons for Men to Celebrate Turning 50</h3>
        <p class="new-lines">

           1. 50 is the new 30.

2. Your grey hair is the new black.

3. The heat from the candles on your birthday cake are an alternative energy source, warming your home as you do your part to fight climate change.

4. Turning down the lights and the thermostat at home with your honey is the act of a cheap and wise man practicing romantic sustainability.

5. You have passed a big mile marker on your “highway to heaven” and there is no turning back.

6. You start to forget your mistakes.

7. You stop wasting your time on selfies.

8. You are much wiser than you were in your 40s and your 30s and we won’t even mention those wasted years of irresponsible frivolity in your 20s.

9. Your children are approaching adulthood, which opens up more time for you to focus on your wife if you’re married, and YOURSELF, no matter what your status.

10. You begin to qualify for senior discounts at second-rate eating establishments such as Arby’s (a free soft drink!), Country Kitchen, Hardee’s, and, of course, iHop.

11. You no longer feel weird when someone calls you “sir.”

12. You probably won’t have to show your ID when buying beer.

13. You reminisce about the days when MTV made music videos.

14. Once you start repeating one of your really great stories, your children can finish it by heart once they stop rolling their eyes.

15. You can accept the reality that the Cleveland Browns will never win a Super Bowl in your lifetime.

16. You are entering what is statistically your peak decade of earning when U.S. men reach an average annual income of $101,200.

17. With your children’s college education paid for, you can now plow money into saving for your own retirement at age 80.

18. Starting at age 50, the IRS allows you to make “catch-up contributions” of up to an additional $6,000 per year! You never, of course, catch up, but you feel better trying.

19. You have entered a decade for career breakthroughs. Ray Kroc opened his first McDonald’s franchise at age 52, creating millions of McJobs, including the one you still have.
     
20. With retirement on the horizon, you can stop griping about that item on your paycheck called FICA.

21. You are joining tens of millions of fellow Gen-Xers entering their “Golden Years.”

22. When the kids (finally) leave the house, PaPa Bird and Mama Bird can get snuggly and reacquainted in the “Empty Nest,” if you know what I mean. If you don’t, see No. 4.

23. If you live to be 100, it’s just “halftime” of your life.

24. If you don’t think you’re going to hit 100, it’s now appropriate to start that exciting, go-for-the-end-zone life strategy called “the two-minute drill.”

25. “Happy hour” is now your nap time.

26. You have a growing appreciation for the spiritual concept called “eternal life.”

27. You can condescendingly call any man 25 or younger “son.”

28. Costco sells comfortable, affordable khakis with expandable waistlines.

29. At 50, your doctor will ask you to get regular colonoscopies, and the good news is they aren’t as scary-painful as they once were. You can now poop in a box and mail it in. TIP: To ensure everything comes out OK, carefully read the 31 pages of instructions and heed the important warnings for people written for the early stages of dementia, such as, “Patients should NOT drink the preservative liquid” (I’m not making this up, folks).

30. You can use the phrase “back in the day” when referring to any part of your personal narrative.

31. Now that you’re making more than 101k (see No. 16) you can start that fun and expensive hobby called golf.

32. With eBay, Etsy, and other websites, you can turn your carved wooden ducks in the shop into a revenue stream!

33. You’re old and wise enough to be a mentor to a young and foolish man.

34. You can hire a lawn service without an ounce of guilt.

35. You have accumulated enough decent material (some of it true) to write that memoir, “My Life in Words,” destined to turn into a dusty family heirloom in the attic of one of your children, where no one will ever read it.

36. You can blame your problems on what your father’s generation called a “midlife crisis,” a handy excuse to buy a red sports car.

37. You can stop wondering what you want to do when you grow up.

38. Crowds get smaller every year at your high school reunion.

40. You have plenty of options in the closet for those “ugly sweater” parties during the holidays.

41. You can join AARP and, believe me, they will remind you.

42. Call it a “senior moment,” and you can get away with pretty much anything!

43. Your kids start calling you the G.O.A.T.

44. You now qualify for the Senior Olympics!

45. You get jump-up-and-down excited about reducing hefty brokerage fees by shifting your investments to more index funds.

46. You are grateful for your tech-savvy ability to eliminate wrinkles from your face utilizing “the Healing Brush” in PhotoShop.

47. A growing love bordering on obsession for user-friendly retirement calculators.

48. You realize it just makes more sense to drive under the speed limit, avoiding those dangerous passing lanes used by people in such a hurry.

49. You are finally getting your head together as the rest of your body falls apart.

50. You have the time to start writing articles like this one, deluding yourself into thinking you are a sage with advice people want to read and follow.
